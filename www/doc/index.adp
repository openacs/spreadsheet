introduction
</h3>
<p>
Spreadsheet provides procedures for building and using tables and 
spreadsheets in OpenACS. This package allows convenient 
building and interpreting of web-based table data via tcl in a web page.
</p><p>
This package provides two different API implementations:
</p>
<ul><li>
Simple Table - stores and retrieves static tables as delimited text.
Most any delimiter is automatically handled on input. Delimiters can
be forced if necessary. Sheets have built-in revisioning and permissions.
</li><li>
Standard spreadsheets - stores and retrieves sheets with formula 
and calculation values stored for each cell. (Not yet implemented)
</li></ul>
